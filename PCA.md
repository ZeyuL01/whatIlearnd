# PCA (Principle Component Analysis)

## 1.eigenvalue and eigenvectors
A $n\times n$ square matrix can be seen as a linear transformation defined in $R^n$ space. eigenvectors are vectors that will only be stretched or scaled by the matrix, the direction of the vector will not be changed, such that:

$$
Av=\lambda v
$$

Here, $v$ is one eigenvector of matrix A and $\lambda$ is the corresponding eigenvalues.
